# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in Misskey, please report it by using GitHub's **Private vulnerability reporting** feature.

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make Misskey safe for everyone.
